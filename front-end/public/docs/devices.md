**Devices control block**

This block provides access to:
- Creating a new device (with the ability to add a description and its status).
- Editing the device.
- Removing the device.

**Options**

If you wish, you can set the device status to "disabled" mode, in which case the device will not be displayed on the telemetry search page.
