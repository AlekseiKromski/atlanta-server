**Server connection status**

This block displays the current connection status to the server. If you disconnect from the server for any reason, a button appears to reconnect.

Disabling will occur in the following cases:
- Server is not available.
- Long inactivity timeout exceeded.
- There is no incoming data.
- You do not have connection permissions (contact to your local administrator), which will be displayed through errors 403 or 401 in the alert.

In all other cases, the server must remain constantly available.
