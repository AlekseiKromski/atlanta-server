**Life data viewing block**

In this block you can choose the option to view the received data. There are 3 types:
- **Map:** Here you can monitor the transmitted data in real time by displaying points on the map. When clicked, you will see all the telemetry at a certain point that was transferred to the server.
- **Chart:** On the chart you can see all available transmitted telemetry and filter them.
- **Table:** The table will show the value and time of the transmitted telemetry.

All transmitted telemetry does not account for data that should be ignored for various reasons.
